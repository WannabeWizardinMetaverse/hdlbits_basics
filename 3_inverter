Solution:

module top_module( input in, output out );
  assign out = ~in;
endmodule

Note:
  There are two operators to realize this function: '~' and '!'
  the difference between them is that '~' is the inverse per bit and '!' is the inverse on logic. For example:
  "wire [2:0] in;
   reg [2:0] out_1;
   reg out_2;
   
   // in the testbench, let "in = 3'b110;"
   assign out_1 = ~ in;
   assign out_2 = !in;
   "
   Then the 'out_1' should be 3'b001 and 'out_2' should be 1'b0
