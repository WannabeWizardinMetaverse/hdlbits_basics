Solution:

module top_module( input in, output out );
	assign out = in;
endmodule


Note:
1. This problem introduce the 'continuous assignment' whose example is shown as follow:
    "assign <port_b>=<port_a>;"

2. 'continuous assignment' means that the <port_b> is the same as <port_a> all the time. 
    the logic for the assignment is to get the output from the inputs.
    the <port_b> represents the output and the <port_a> represents the inputs.
